Beginning
Hi Everyone (Alternate title: Hello World 2).

I am here hoping to learn a lot about coding, especially databases. I have done a little bit of programming throughout my life starting with Basic back in the 1980s! A long time ago. A different era I have taken some programming classes before and am hoping to learn a lot. Thanks all!
